# Rwanda Transport Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a dynamic and insightful dashboard designed to analyze public sentiment and leverage AI and IoT solutions for optimizing Rwanda's public transportation system, particularly concerning its new distance-based fare structure. By aggregating and visualizing data from various public sources, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of citizen feedback, identifies key areas of concern, and offers actionable recommendations for policy makers and transport operators.

## Features

The dashboard is built with **React** and **Vite** for a fast and efficient development experience, and utilizes **Recharts** for its powerful and customizable charting capabilities. Key features include:

* **Sentiment Analysis**:
    * **Sentiment Trend Over Time**: Track the evolution of public sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) regarding the transport system.
    * **Sentiment by Area**: Visualize sentiment distribution across different geographical areas (e.g., Nyarugenge, Gasabo, Kicukuro).
    * **Key Issues Identified**: Pinpoint the most pressing concerns voiced by the public, such as "Cost increase for long distances" or "Fare calculation transparency."
    * **Recent Public Comments**: Display a feed of actual public comments from various platforms (Twitter, Facebook, local forums, surveys), categorized by sentiment.

* **AI & IoT Solutions**:
    * **AI-Powered Fare Optimization Recommendations**: Discover AI-generated recommendations for improving the fare system, including "Peak/Off-peak Differentiation," "Zone-Based Approach," and "Fare Caps."
    * **IoT Device Deployment Status**: Monitor the deployment and optimal coverage of various IoT devices like GPS trackers, passenger counters, and NFC readers.
    * **IoT Implementation Strategy**: Understand the strategic use of different IoT devices to enhance the transport system.
    * **AI + IoT Integration Benefits**: Explore how the synergy between AI and IoT leads to benefits like "Dynamic Fare Adjustment," "Personalized Fare Recommendations," "Predictive Maintenance," and "Fraud Detection."

## Technologies Used

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a quicker and leaner development workflow for modern web projects.
* **Recharts**: A composable charting library built with React and D3.
* **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful and customizable open-source icons.
* **Tailwind CSS** (likely, given the utility-first classes in `index.css` and component styling): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
